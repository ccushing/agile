                    <p>This is the final project web site for ISMT E-101 : Agile Project Management. (Spring 2016)</p>

                    <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
                    <h4>Overview</h4>
                    <p>In the emerging open sourced world of technology, it is difficult to sort through the relevant and appropriate technologies to employ for specific projects. Software Developers need to know where they should focus their attention to keep their skills up to date. Technology managers need to know which platforms are best suited to their needs and which ones are becoming obsolete. Many people in the information technology field need a comprehensive and unbiased source which monitors current trends in platforms and frameworks across different industries in order to make better informed decisions regarding the infrastructure and architecture of their own organizations.</p>
                    <p>The Technology Reference Guide is a web site intended for IT industry professionals which collects data from industry publications, social media, and subject matter experts where users can quickly keep up to date on the emerging trends in IT by industry and technology space. We differentiate ourselves from other sites by employing data analytics technology which allows our content managers and subject matter experts to provide constant up to date data taken from the industry as a whole.</p>
                    <p>We are using the Agile project management methodology to implement this solution. With Agile, our work is divided into milestone projects called sprints. Sprints typically last 2 weeks and a set of tasks taken from our project backlog are slated to be completed in the current sprint. This approach allows us to be flexible in the face of changing requirements and keeps our team focused on providing incremental value. At the end of each sprint, we conduct a retrospective on how we can improve on how we deliver and begin planning on what we will deliver for our next sprint.</p>
                    <h4>Current Status</h4>
                        <p>Below is the current status of our project. We have broken down the project into 4 major phases : Design, Develop, Content and Marketing. The red line indicates where we are today and each task has a %Complete bar associated with it. Green bars indicate the project milestone is on track or completed. Yellow indicates that this milestone may be in danger of being behind. Red indicates that the milestone is behind our anticipated delivery date and needs to be watched more closely.</p>
                        <p>So far, we are on target with the design phase of our project. We have created the website wireframe mockups,  and are on target with the database and site architecture documents. Some issues concerning the design of the data analytics engine have caused delays in completion of the middleware design document, however, we anticipate that these issues will be resolved and have put a higher priority on working on these issues in our next sprint.</p>
                        <p>We are ahead of schedule for creating our development and production server environments. The choice to set up our infrastructure in the cloud has made setting up these servers much easier.  We were not sure at first what obstacles we would run into in doing this, but it seems we had almost no problems getting everything set up correctly.</p>
                        <p>The Content phase of our project has been delayed due to limited resource availability. As a result, we are planning to get more firm commitments on time and we will push the start dates for our content phase further out. We do not anticipate this will impact our go live date for Q2 2017.</p>
                        <img src="content/roadmap2.png">

                    <h4>Next Steps</h4>
                        <p>We are currently in sprint #2 of our project. Details and updated progress can be viewed on our Trello board (<a href="https://trello.com/b/dwwIqFl1/chuck-s-technology-reference-guide" target="_blank">link</a>).  As we approach the end of Q2 2016, we anticipate for Q3 2016 that we will have most of the site design completed with the exception of the data analytics engine which may stretch into Q4 2016. We will enter the Develop phase of the project in Q3 2016 and anticipate that our prototype site will be complete and ready to go live in Q4 2016. The Content Manager and Marketing Director will also start work on their respective milestone in Q3 2016.</p>

                    <p>
                        I am from Portland, Maine which is about 2 hours north of Boston. In college I studied finance and economics with a minor in computer science. I started my career as an analyst with Wells Fargo in San Francisco and began studying Systems Analysis and Design at UC Berkeley. After a couple of years, I was working in Silicon Valley during the .com boom of the mid 1990’s. This was a very exciting and interesting place to be at the time. At this time I focused my career on business intelligence and data warehouse design. I eventually found my way back to the Boston area, got married and have been living just north of Boston for the past 14 years. In that time I have spent over 10 years as an independent contractor doing software development and the last 5 years working for the Federal Reserve System where I manage a team of developers. During my career I have worn many hats. I have been a scrum master, a project manager, a product owner, a subject matter expert, and a software developer.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Successes, Challenges, Lessons Learned.
                    </h4>
                    <p>
                        Working as a contractor provided me with the unique opportunity to work on many different projects across many different organizations and industries. I could see what worked and what did not. I could also see the common challenges different companies face with software development. I like to think that I was doing agile development before the term was really applied in the software world. The most common challenge I saw in developing software was not achieving the technical capacity to deliver on a solution, but the constantly changing requirements during the development cycle. As a developer, you are put in the awkward position of having to tell the people paying your salary that they have to stop otherwise they are going to sink the project. Having a backlog would allow me to never have to say no, but at the same time, it would force project sponsors to prioritize requirements in the face of time and budget constraints. Keeping them constantly engaged and part of a feedback cycle would guard against any surprises when the solution would be delivered. This is in contrast to the more traditional waterfall methodology where requirements would be documented in detail and a few months later the solution would be presented to stakeholders with the hope that they would be happy with the end result. Over many years and many projects I have seen the needle vacillate between a more structured approach like waterfall and a less structured approach like agile. I think both methodologies have their strengths and weaknesses and some projects are better suited to agile while some are better suited to waterfall. Agile lends itself to small project teams where the desired outcome is not well defined or there are a lot of stakeholders involved. Waterfall seems to be better for teams with a lot of people and interdependencies where the solution is well defined and agreed upon up front.
                    </p>
                    <h4>What I hope to learn</h4>
                    <p>I am looking forward to learning from other people’s experiences. I would like to learn more about agile from the product owner’s perspective and become more familiar with the agile ceremonies and artifacts. I tend to hear “that is not really agile” a lot from different colleagues, so, I would like to be more in depth with my knowledge of agile and hopefully be able to call myself an expert or at least a qualified practitioner. We are also applying a lot of agile principles with my current team and I hope to be able to apply what I learn here to the projects I am working on. </p>

                    <h3>Project Concept</h3>
                    <a href="content/Project.docx" class="original-document">Link to original document</a>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Technology Reference Guide</h4>
                    <p>This is an idea for a web site and annual publication which keeps track of the latest trends in technology throughout different industries. The purpose would be to identify and categorize technologies, such as programming languages and frameworks based on their popularity and function. The site would be a real-time encyclopedia of technology and related products. Data collected from social media and industry publications would be used to rank and categorize each respective technology in terms of popularity and function.</p>
                    <p>I came up with this idea because I have found it difficult to find an unbiased and comprehensive place where I can search and keep up to date on emerging technologies. With the move toward everything being open sourced, it is a challenge to sort through and keep on top of all the different tools, frameworks and systems available in the tech world. This web site would make it easy to browse and make sense of the dizzying array of tools which are available.</p>
                    <p>I think this would be a good project for Agile because the end solution could look end up looking many different ways and there can be many paths to achieving the end result. I also think the project is just about right in terms of team size.</p>

                            Acme bike needs to increase revenue across all lines of their business. The population of Bellow Falls is 3,100 people and steadily declining since 1920s. Taking the whole Windham County into account, we can see that the pool of potential customers is only 43,500. Bicycle industry is highly seasonal business; it relies on discretionary spending and economic conditions. The growth of online shopping leads to closure of several local business in Windham County, the online shopping experience is also becoming more and more sophisticated; therefore reducing foot traffic to traditional brick and mortar store. This presents significant challenge for the ACME bicycles, and in order to compete, ACME has to launch a state-of-the-art website allowing customers from anywhere in the world to buy their customized bikes and accessories online Essential to achieving this goal will be to expand from their local market in Vermont to a national or global market for selling customized bikes. A web site which allows users to view, customize to their needs and order products from Acme will be the first step towards moving out of an exclusively local market and into a global market.

                    <p class="c4 c7"><span></span></p>
                    <p class="c4 c17"><span>Acme bike needs to increase revenue across all lines of their business. </span><span>The population of Bellow Falls is 3,100 people and steadily declining since 1920s. Taking the whole Windham County into account, we can see that the pool of potential customers is only 43,500. Bicycle industry is highly seasonal business; it relies on discretionary spending and economic conditions. </span><span>The growth of online shopping leads to closure of several local business in Windham County, the online shopping experience is also becoming more and more sophisticated; therefore reducing foot traffic to traditional brick and mortar store. </span><span>This presents significant challenge for the ACME bicycles, and in order to compete, ACME has to launch a state-of-the-art website allowing customers from anywhere in the world to buy their customized bikes and accessories online</span><span>&nbsp;Essential to achieving this goal will be to expand from their local market in Vermont to a national or global market for selling customized bikes. A web site which allows users to view, customize to their needs and order products from Acme will be the first step towards moving out of an exclusively local market and into a global market.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt1" id="cmnt_ref1">[a]</a></sup></p>

                        <p><strong>PROJECT NAME</strong>: Technology Reference Guide</p>
                        <p></p>
                        <p><strong>THE NEED</strong></p>
                        <p>In the emerging open sourced world of technology, it is difficult to sort through the relevant and appropriate technologies to employ for specific projects. Software Developers need to know where they should focus their attention to keep their skills up to date. Technology managers need to know which platforms are best suited to their needs and which ones are becoming obsolete. Many people in the information technology field need a <u>comprehensive</u> and <u>unbiased</u> source which monitors current trends in platforms and frameworks across different industries in order to make better informed decisions regarding the infrastructure and architecture of their own organizations. </p>
                        <p></p>
                        <p><strong>The One Sentence Summary</strong></p>
                        <p>We will implement a web site intended for IT industry professionals which collects data from industry publications, social media, and subject matter experts where users can quickly keep up to date on the emerging trends in IT by industry and technology space. </p>
                        <p><strong>Definition of Done</strong></p>
                        <p>The project will be considered done when the following 4 functional components have been implemented and verified to be working as intended by the product owner.</p>
                        <p>&middot; Create a web site which allows subject matter experts to create content related to technologies where they are designated to be experts.</p>
                        <p>&middot; Create a data warehouse which routinely collects data from industry RSS feeds and social media posts in order to rank and identify technology trends in IT.</p>
                        <p>&middot; Create a public web site which presents technology trend data in an easy to understand and categorized hierarchy.</p>
                        <p></p>
                        <p><strong>The Why</strong></p>
                        <p>It is difficult for IT professionals to keep on top of all the IT related platforms, frameworks and products that available at any given time. It is hard to identify actual trends within the industry that are not tainted by biased coverage. Consumer reports magazine was able to bring clarity to the automobile and consumer durable goods industry for consumers. This web site will strive to be the Consumer Reports equivalent for products and technologies related to the IT industry.</p>
                        <p><strong>WOW! FACTOR</strong></p>
                        <p>Information Technology professionals will finally have a single source where they can keep up to date with the latest and greatest technologies. The rapid pace of change in the IT world makes it very difficult to sort through what&rsquo;s new, what&rsquo;s old, and what is the most relevant. This site will categorize and rank the most relevant technologies today in an easy to understand and intuitive format. Predictive analytics algorithms will be used on the back end to help identify real trends in technology that do not rely on potentially biased input from subject matter experts.</p>
                        <p><strong>Project Priorities</strong></p>
                        <p>1. <strong>Customer Satisfaction</strong> &ndash; The success of the project will largely depend on how useful people find it.</p>
                        <p>2. <strong>Quality</strong> &ndash; Quality is always important, but the quality of the information on the site is particularly important because it will be a major factor in determining how useful people find it to be.</p>
                        <p>3. <strong>Scope &ndash; </strong>Actual resources for this project are very limited, so, keeping the scope of what we are trying to achieve will be important.</p>
                        <p>4. <strong>Cost &ndash; </strong>Most of the cost for the initial phase of this project will come from development and design hours from the team, which for now, is free. </p>
                        <p>5. <strong>Team Satisfaction &ndash; </strong>Most projects would not rank this as being high, however, since the team is not being paid, it is important that they find compensation in other ways, such as being satisfied with the work they are doing and taking ownership of the final deliverable.</p>
                        <p>6. <strong>Schedule &ndash; </strong>The project schedule is flexible, but the project scope is not.</p>
                        <p>7. <strong>ROI &ndash; </strong>Revenue generation will not be a priority for this project. Although it will become an important metric further down the road, right now, we want to focus on delivering a working site that people find useful. If we can achieve that, then we can start thinking about profit. </p>
                        <p><strong>PROJECT BOUNDARIES</strong>:</p>
                        <p>The following items will be considered out of scope for this project.</p>
                        <p><strong>No advertising on the site</strong> &ndash; We do intend to raise revenue on the site through advertising, however, we must first get enough traffic to the site before we can open a revenue stream through advertising. This will eventually be implemented by carefully balancing the goals of remaining unbiased and keeping the site useable and friendly.</p>
                        <p><strong>Content for the site will be limited to the following categories</strong></p>
                        <p>&middot; Programming Languages</p>
                        <p>&middot; Platforms and Operating Systems</p>
                        <p>&middot; Cloud Service Providers</p>
                        <p>&middot; Database Software</p>
                        <p>&middot; Development Platforms</p>
                        <p>&middot; Open Source Frameworks &amp; Libraries</p>
                        <p>&middot; Enterprise Security and Encryption</p>
                        <p>&middot; Personal Productivity Software</p>
                        <p><strong>User Feedback mechanism for the site: </strong>We will eventually want to open a way for our users to take part in our ranking process, however, for this project, it is considered out of scope.</p>
                        <p><strong>Annual Publication &ndash; </strong>We are hoping to eventually have our major revenue stream through an annual publication which identifies the major trends we see in our data over the past year. For now, this will be considered out of scope as well.</p>
                        <p><strong>PROJECT IMPERATIVES</strong></p>
                        <p>The following metrics must be met in order to call the project a success. The metrics are split into two categories; metrics for site usage and metrics for site content. We are not concentrating on revenue measures at this time.</p>
                        <p><strong>Usage Metrics</strong> &ndash; This set of metrics measures the degree to which the site it being used. Data comes directly from the usage and log data generated by the web site.</p>
                        <p>&middot; <strong>Average Page Views per month: </strong>We have a goal of a baseline of 15,000 page views per month after the site launch with 25% yearly growth thereafter.</p>
                        <p>&middot; <strong>Unique visitors per day: </strong>Our goal is for a baseline of 50 unique visitors per day after the site launch with 25% yearly growth.</p>
                        <p>&middot; <strong>Unique Page views per User: </strong>Our goal is for an average 10 page views per user per visit after the site launch and maintain that ratio to be between 10 and 15.</p>
                        <p><strong>Content Metrics</strong> &ndash; This set of metrics measures the quantity and quality of content provided on the web site. Data is taken from the content database which provides data to the web site.</p>
                        <p>&middot; Content Turnover Ratio &ndash; This is a general measure of how often old content is replaced with new. On average, this ratio should be at about 60 days. That is, a page dedicated to a particular technology will, on average, be updated every 60 days.</p>
                        <p>&middot; New Content Ratio &ndash; This measures the amount of new technology content as a percentage of all the content. This should be at about 5%.</p>
                        <p>&middot; Old Content Ratio &ndash; This measures the amount of old technology content which will be removed from the site as a percentage of all the content. This should also be at about 5%.</p>
                        <p>&middot; Number of content pages &ndash; This is a baseline number for how many technology content pages should be available on the site. I am estimating this number to be a constant at around 1,000 pages.</p>
                        <p><strong>THE VISION</strong></p>
                        <p>The technology reference guide website will be the recognized source for unbiased and comprehensive analysis of the most relevant technologies, platforms and frameworks used in the information technology field.</p>
